# AI Integration Plan for Tales Craft AI

## 1. Overall Architecture

### 1.1 Agentic Workflow Architecture
We will implement an agentic workflow where specialized agents handle specific tasks in the game mechanics. This approach allows for:
- Modular development and testing
- Clear separation of concerns
- Optimized AI resource usage
- Easier debugging and maintenance

### 1.2 Core Principles
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Minimize AI calls by using deterministic code where possible
- **Context Management**: Efficiently manage and pass context between agents
- **Fallback Systems**: Implement non-AI fallbacks for reliability
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic implementation, enhance incrementally

## 2. Core Agents and Responsibilities

### 2.1 Lore Manager

### 2.4 Narrative Director (Game Master)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Generate story progression based on player actions
  - Describe environments and situations
  - Maintain narrative coherence
- **Implementation**:
  - AI-powered with careful prompt engineering
  - Context window management for story continuity
  - Caching of common narrative patterns

### 2.5 NPC Roleplayer
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Generate NPC dialogue and actions
  - Maintain consistent NPC personalities
- **Implementation**:
  - AI-powered with NPC personality as context
  - Memory of past interactions with player

### 2.6 Encounter Generator
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create combat and non-combat encounters
  - Balance difficulty based on player stats
- **Implementation**:
  - Template-based generation with code
  - AI enhancement for unique elements and descriptions

### 2.7 Decision Engine
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Process player decisions
  - Determine consequences and state changes
- **Implementation**:
  - Rule-based system for common decisions
  - AI for handling unexpected player choices

### 2.8 Combat Orchestrator
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage turn-based combat mechanics
  - Calculate outcomes of combat actions
- **Implementation**:
  - Pure code solution for mechanics
  - AI enhancement for narrative descriptions of combat

## 3. Data Flows and Dependencies

### 3.1 Context Management System
- Centralized context manager to track game state
- Selective context passing to minimize token usage
- Context priority system (what to keep/discard when context window fills)

### 3.2 Agent Communication Patterns
```
[Character Manager] ⟷ [Context Manager] ⟷ [Narrative Director]
       ↑                     ↑                    ↑
       |                     |                    |
[Decision Engine] ← [Encounter Generator] → [NPC Roleplayer]
       ↑                     ↑                    ↑
       |                     |                    |
[Combat Orchestrator] ← [Lore Manager] → [NPC Manager]
```

### 3.3 State Persistence
- Database schema for saving game state
- Serialization/deserialization of AI context
- Checkpoint system to restore state efficiently

## 4. AI API Integration

### 4.1 LLM Selection Criteria
- Response quality for narrative tasks
- Context window size
- Cost per token
- Response speed
- Available fine-tuning options

### 4.2 API Integration Points
- Streaming responses for real-time narrative
- Batched requests for non-time-critical generation
- Error handling and retry logic

### 4.3 Prompt Engineering Strategy
- System prompts for consistent game world behavior
- Dynamic prompt assembly based on game state
- Prompt templates for different agent types

## 5. Implementation Priorities

### 5.1 Phase 1: Core Framework (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Context management system
- [ ] Basic agent interfaces
- [ ] LLM API connection and testing
- [ ] Simple prompt templates

### 5.2 Phase 2: Essential Agents (Days 5-6)
- [ ] Character Manager (code-based)
- [ ] Narrative Director (AI-powered)
- [ ] Simple Lore Manager (database)
- [ ] Basic NPC templates

### 5.3 Phase 3: Game Mechanics (Days 7-8)
- [ ] Decision Engine
- [ ] Combat Orchestrator
- [ ] NPC Roleplayer enhancement
- [ ] Basic Encounter Generator

### 5.4 Phase 4: Polish and Optimization (Days 9-10)
- [ ] Prompt refinement for better responses
- [ ] Context window optimization
- [ ] Fallback systems for API failures
- [ ] Caching strategies implementation

## 6. Cost Optimization Strategies

### 6.1 Token Usage Reduction
- Truncate history based on relevance
- Summarize past events instead of keeping full history
- Use embeddings to retrieve relevant context only when needed

### 6.2 Caching System
- Cache common AI responses for similar situations
- Implement tiered caching (memory → localStorage → database)
- Cache invalidation rules based on game state changes

### 6.3 Hybrid Approaches
- Use templates with variable filling where possible
- AI enhancement of template-generated content only when needed
- Progressive detail generation (generate details only when player focuses on something)
