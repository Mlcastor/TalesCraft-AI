# Best Practises

- Never use "use client;" in "APP" pages.
- Separate components into many reusable sub-components.
- Never use API endpoints and use server actions instead.
- Define the theme in "global.css" never hard coded in classname.
- Use "shadcn" reusable components which follow accessibility standards.
